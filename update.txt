To update Arorex Browser, you need to follow 3 steps:

1. Check whether the version of the Arorex Browser is greater or not, by 
going to github.com/Mr-CodeStar/

2. If the version is greater, then delete all the files except the 
history.txt file from your system, and then copy all the files present 
in the repo.

And you're ready to use your updated Arorex Browser!
